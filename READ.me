# Kos - Digital Expert / Shopify Learning Hub

Hey 👋  

This repository contains all the Shopify code snippets and examples that are referenced in my articles on [my website](https://digital-expert.co.uk).  
If you arrived here from one of my articles, you are in the right place to copy the exact code used and adapt it to your own store.

---

## What this repo is for

- Practical Shopify code snippets and features that you can drop into your Shopify store.
- Code that is always linked to a specific article on [my website](https://digital-expert.co.uk) so you understand not only **what** to paste, but **why** it works.
- Clean, readable examples focused on real ecommerce solutions.

This repo is especially useful if you prefer to learn by reading an explanation first and then working with real code.

## How to use this repository

1. **Read the article first** – Check the `README.md` file in this folder for the direct link back to the full tutorial on [digital-expert.co.uk](https://digital-expert.co.uk).
2. Copy the code/files.
3. Paste into your Shopify store/theme and follow the **comments inside the code** - they'll tell you exactly what to change for your store.
4. Test it on a draft theme or development store before publishing live.

⚠️ **Important Disclaimer**  
This code is provided to help store owners improve their Shopify stores. However, I am **not responsible** for any issues, downtime, lost sales, or damage that may occur. Always: 
- Test on a **development theme/store first**  
- **Backup your live theme** before applying changes  
- Contact a **developer** if you need help

## Who this is for

- **Shopify developers** who want copy‑paste‑ready code.
- **Store owners with little/no coding experience** who want advanced features and are confident following simple instructions.
- **Learners** who want to learn about Shopify and understand how stores are built.

## Structure of the repo

**One folder per article** – named exactly as the tutorial title.  

Inside each folder:  
- All code files for that tutorial (Liquid, JS, CSS)  
- Optional subfolders matching Shopify structure (`sections/`, `snippets/`, `assets/`) if complex  
- `README.md` with article link and usage notes  

**Newsletter links go straight to the right folder.**
